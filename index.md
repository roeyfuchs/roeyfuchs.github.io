Hello! Iâ€™m **Roey Fuchs**, great to see you here! ðŸ‘‹  
  
Iâ€™m a software engineer at [Radware](https://www.radware.com/), specializing in backend development. With a deep passion for coding, I enjoy optimizing performance and making code run faster. ðŸ’» Iâ€™m always curious and eager to learn, whether itâ€™s through reading or diving into new technologies.  


In my free time â€” when Iâ€™m not battling bugs or optimizing code â€” Iâ€™m pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science at the Open University of Israel, building on my background with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Neuroscience from Bar Ilan University.

Iâ€™d love to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roeyfuchs) to share insights and collaborate. If youâ€™re passionate about coding or a fellow Vim enthusiast, letâ€™s chat! ðŸ––
