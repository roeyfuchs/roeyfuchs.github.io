    <h2><a href="/blog/2020/home-they-brought/">Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead</a></h2>
    <p>Home they brought her warrior dead:
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:
All her maidens, watching, said,
‘She must weep or she will die.’
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2019/jelly-fish/">A Jelly-Fish</a></h2>
    <p>Visible, invisible,
A fluctuating charm,
An amber-colored amethyst
Inhabits it; your arm
Approaches, and
It opens and
It closes;
You have meant
To catch it,
And it shrivels;
You abandon
Your intent—
It opens, and it
Closes and you
Reach for it—
The blue
Surrounding it
Grows cloudy, and
It floats away
From you.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2019/some-more/">Another sample post</a></h2>
    <p>He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/blog/2018/atticus/">A sample post</a></h2>
    <p>Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.
